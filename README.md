Puzzle 8 solved using bfs, dfs, bestFirst and A*

DFS and BFS are useless, because it takes too much time. BFS when it finds a solution it will be the shortest path.

BestFirst is the fastest method, but its not guaranteed that it finds the shortest path

A* is the second fastest but it will always find the shortest solution.
